# SDL2 Snake test

## Overview

This is a little snake test I wrote in SDL2 with OpenGL 3.3. It has basic 2D pathtraced lighting, the shader for that is under `assets/lights.frag` if you want to play with that.

## Build Instructions

### Linux

Run `make clean ; make` from the project directory.

### Windows

Didn't write a build script for windows lol.
